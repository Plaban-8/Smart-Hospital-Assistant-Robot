# Track and Navigation

## 1. Track layout and QR placement

![Track layout](diagrams/track-layout.svg)


```
[STATION]════●═══════●═══════●═══════●═══════════
              │       │       │       │      ↑
            Bed 1   Bed 2   Bed 3   Turn   15cm
                                    zone   spare line
```

`═` is the guide line. `●` is a perpendicular black strip spanning wider than the full array.

| Marker | Width | QR payload | QR faces |
|---|---|---|---|
| Station | 50mm | `STATION` | Toward the beds (seen on the return leg) |
| Bed 1…n | 30mm | `BED1`…`BEDn` | Toward the station (seen outbound) |
| Turn zone | 30mm | `TURNAROUND` | Toward the station (seen outbound) |

The camera faces the direction of travel, so each QR must face **toward the oncoming car**.

**Leave at least 15cm of guide line past the turn-zone marker.** Phase 1 of the spin creeps forward to clear the marker; if the tape ends there, the car drives onto bare floor and faults.

**Give the turn zone 25cm+ clearance on both sides.** With the caster at the front, the spin centre is the rear axle, so the whole front of the chassis sweeps an arc with a radius equal to the axle-to-front-corner distance.

**Put a physical bumper at the station** so the car parks in the same spot regardless of braking distance.

### 1.1 QR printing

- **Matte paper, not glossy** — glossy reflects ceiling lights straight into the lens.
- Short payloads only: `BED1`, `STATION`, `TURNAROUND`. Uppercase, no spaces, no URLs, no JSON — fewer modules means an easier decode at distance.
- Mount at camera height, angled slightly toward the approach.
- Print `TURNAROUND` at the same size as the rest. It is the code the car relies on most — the only thing that gets it home when something else has gone wrong.

### 1.2 Size depends on what the camera can actually resolve

Decoding needs a minimum number of *pixels per QR module*, so the size you must print scales with the sensor's output resolution. Check which one you have — the camera's own page and `/status` both report it, and the serial banner prints it at boot.

| Camera output | Why | Print size | Working distance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 640×480 | OV2640, hardware JPEG | 40mm | 15–25cm |
| 400×296 | OV2640 with `LOW_POWER_BENCH` on | 50–60mm | 12–20cm |
| 320×240 | Sensor without a JPEG encoder, software fallback | **70–80mm** | **10–15cm** |

The 640×480 row is what the rest of this document was designed around. The lower rows are derived from it by pixel count and are a **starting point, not a measurement.**

### 1.3 Measure your own numbers before building the track

The distances above set the camera's standoff from the markers, which sets the mounting bracket, which sets the chassis layout. Get them wrong and you find out after the track is taped down.

Measure them directly with the scan tool in the PC app:

1. Start `pc/app.py` and open the control page.
2. Print `BED1` at the size from the table.
3. Hold it in front of the lens and press **Scan QR now**.
4. Back away until it stops decoding reliably.

Record what you find:

| Measured | Value |
|---|---|
| Camera output resolution | |
| QR print size | |
| Furthest reliable decode | |
| Decode time at that distance | |

**Reliable means first-attempt.** If a decode only succeeds on the second or third try, or takes several hundred milliseconds of retrying, you are at the edge — the car will fail there once vibration and changing light are involved. Take 70% of the furthest distance you measured as the real working figure.

## 2. Navigation logic

### 2.1 The one rule

> Line-follow forward. When all five IR channels read black, stop. Capture a QR image. Act on whatever ID comes back.

No counters. No dead reckoning. No position variable. The car does not know or care where it is until a QR tells it.

**Why:** a counter is state that can drift. One slipped wheel and the car believes it is at bed 2 while standing at bed 3, with nothing detecting the error. With QR-only identity there is no such state to corrupt. The worst failure is that the car takes longer than expected — never that it delivers to the wrong patient.

### 2.2 Dispatch table

| Scanned ID | State | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `STATION` | Outbound with medicine | Ignore, resume |
| `STATION` | Returning | Stop. Enter `STANDBY`. |
| `BED<n>` where n == target | Outbound | Stop. Unlock sequence. |
| `BED<n>` where n ≠ target | Outbound | Resume driving |
| `TURNAROUND` | Outbound | Execute 180° spin, set `returning = true` |
| `TURNAROUND` | Returning | Should never happen — fault |
| Any | Returning | Ignore unless `STATION` |
| Nothing decoded | Any | Hand off to nurse manual verify |

The `TURNAROUND` row makes the missing-QR case free: if the target bed's code is damaged, the car keeps going, reaches the turn zone, spins, returns to `STATION`, and never unlocks. No separate end-of-line detection needed.

### 2.3 Marker debounce

- Require all-five-black for **at least 60ms** before treating it as a marker
- Require at least **300ms of not-all-black** before the next marker registers

Without this, one strip triggers several times.

### 2.4 Line following

Use a weighted position from all five channels. With sensors numbered 1–5 left to right and `b[i]` = 1 when black:

```
position = (1*b1 + 2*b2 + 3*b3 + 4*b4 + 5*b5) / (b1+b2+b3+b4+b5)
error    = position - 3.0
```

Feed `error` to a PID and apply the output differentially to the two motor PWMs.

**Start with a low proportional gain.** With the caster at the front, the array is far from the pivot, so a small heading error produces a large sensor swing. Tune P first with I and D at zero, then add a little D to damp overshoot.

## 3. The 180° spin

The car is standing **on** the all-black marker when it decides to turn. "Spin until the centre sensor finds the line" cannot work there — every sensor already reads black. And on the way back it immediately re-crosses that same marker.

| Phase | Action | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Creep forward at 45% PWM to clear the marker | Sensors no longer all-black, ~5cm |
| 2 | Spin blind: left motor forward, right reverse, 55% PWM | 80% of calibrated 180° time |
| 3 | Continue spinning at **35% PWM** | Centre channel (`OUT3`) reads black |
| 4 | Stop both motors, settle | 200ms |
| 5 | Set `markerCooldown`, resume line following | 2000ms of ignoring all-black |

**Phase 5 is essential.** Without it the car re-detects the turn-zone marker one second after spinning and stops again, forever.

**Phase 3 runs slower than phase 2** because with the front-caster layout the array is far from the pivot and sweeps across the line quickly. At 45% it can pass the line between sensor reads.

### 3.1 Calibrating phase 2

1. Put the car on a clear patch of floor, off the line.
2. Command a spin at 55% PWM and time a full 180° by eye.
3. Repeat five times, average. Expect roughly 900–1200ms.
4. Set the blind phase to **80%** of that average.
5. Re-measure with a half-drained battery. Spin time stretches as the pack sags — which is exactly why phase 3 exists rather than trusting the timer alone.

Use 55% duty, not full speed. A fast spin overshoots and phase 3 never converges.

```cpp
const uint16_t SPIN_BLIND_MS      = 880;   // 80% of measured 1100ms
const uint8_t  SPIN_PWM           = 140;   // ~55% of 255
const uint8_t  SPIN_SLOW_PWM      = 90;    // ~35% of 255
const uint8_t  CREEP_PWM          = 115;   // ~45% of 255
const uint16_t MARKER_COOLDOWN_MS = 2000;
```
